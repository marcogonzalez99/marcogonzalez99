## 🔐 About Code Access

Most of my work lives in private repositories to protect the IP behind SB Studios games, tools, and hardware projects. I’m a solo developer building original content from the ground up, from the game engine to the physical console.

If you're an employer, recruiter, or collaborator and would like to view the source code:  
> 📩 **Send me a message.** I’m happy to grant access or walk through the architecture, design decisions, and technical stack.
